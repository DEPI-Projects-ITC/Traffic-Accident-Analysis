## Overview

Welcome to the **Traffic Accident Analysis Report** repository! This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, undertaken by a dedicated team of students under the supervision of Dr. Eman Ghanem. Our goal was to deeply analyze traffic accidents to uncover patterns, contributing factors, and potential preventive measures that could enhance public safety.

## Problem Statement

Traffic accidents are a pressing public safety issue, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities each year. Understanding the trends and factors contributing to these incidents is essential for effective prevention and informed policy-making. 

## Data-Driven Exploration

To guide our investigation, we posed several key questions:
- What trends and contributing factors are associated with traffic accidents over time?
- How do different periods affect accident frequency?
- What environmental and situational conditions contribute to these incidents?
- How can data insights improve public safety measures?

## Data Modeling

We created a structured data model consisting of:

1. **Date Table (DimDate_Table)**: This table facilitates time-based analysis and includes attributes like date, year, month, and weekday.

2. **Date Periods Table (DimDate_Periods)**: Designed for dynamic filtering, this table allows analysis based on different time frames.

3. **Relationships**: We established relationships between our tables to enable comprehensive trend analysis.

Our interactive dashboard offers a comprehensive view of traffic accidents, equipped with various slicers, filters, and visualizations. Key features include:

- **Date Slicers**: For selecting specific time frames.
- **Popup Filters**: To provide additional filtering options without cluttering the interface.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualizations that update based on user selections.

## Key Insights

Through our analysis, we discovered several critical insights:
- **Peak Accident Times**: Most accidents occur during morning and evening rush hours.
- **Environmental Factors**: Rainy conditions correlate with increased accident rates.
- **Injury Trends**: Serious injuries are more frequent in high-speed zones.
- **Seasonal Variations**: Higher accident rates are observed during holiday seasons.

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we propose several actionable recommendations:
- **Policy Implementation**: Stricter speed regulations during peak accident hours.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educating drivers about risks during adverse weather conditions.
- **Traffic Law Enforcement**: Increasing police presence in high-accident zones.
- **Further Research**: Continuing data-driven analysis to refine preventive measures.

## Acknowledgments
